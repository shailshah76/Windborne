## üìù Notes

- The Windborne API data may sometimes be corrupted or incomplete - the application handles this robustly
- **Air Traffic Integration**: The application integrates OpenSky Network API for real-time aircraft tracking data from ADS-B receivers worldwide. This enables comprehensive safety analysis between balloons and aircraft, including altitude conflict detection and collision risk assessment. The API provides detailed aircraft information including position, altitude, speed, and heading.
- **Safety Analysis**: The system uses established aviation safety standards with 5km horizontal and 300m vertical separation distances for safety zone calculations.
- **Live Air Traffic**: Air traffic data is **disabled by default** to avoid API rate limiting - use the "Live Air Traffic" toggle to enable comprehensive analysis
- **Mock Data**: When the OpenSky API is unavailable, the system generates realistic mock aircraft data for demonstration purposes
- **Real-time Updates**: The application automatically refreshes data every 15 minutes with manual refresh capability
- **Units**: All calculations use metric units for consistency
- **Data Processing**: Coordinate validation automatically fixes swapped latitude/longitude values from the Windborne API
- **Analysis Panel**: The right panel now displays comprehensive text-based analysis instead of charts, providing detailed insights into balloon-aircraft interactions
