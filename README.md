## üå¨Ô∏è Why OpenAQ API?

I chose [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/) as the second external dataset because air quality data provides crucial insights into atmospheric composition that affects balloon behavior and environmental monitoring. OpenAQ offers several advantages:

- **No API Key Required**: Completely free for non-commercial use, no registration needed
- **Global Coverage**: Air quality data from over 100 countries and 10,000+ locations
- **Real-time Data**: Live air quality measurements from government and research stations
- **Multiple Pollutants**: PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO, and more
- **Standardized Format**: Consistent data format across all sources
- **Historical Data**: Access to historical air quality trends and patterns

Air quality affects balloon performance in several ways:

- **Atmospheric Density**: Pollutants can affect air density and balloon buoyancy
- **Wind Patterns**: Air quality often correlates with weather patterns and wind conditions
- **Visibility**: Poor air quality can impact balloon visibility and tracking
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Balloons can serve as mobile air quality sensors
- **Research Applications**: Study the relationship between air quality and atmospheric conditions

By combining air quality data with weather and balloon tracking, we create a comprehensive atmospheric monitoring system that can:

- **Environmental Research**: Study pollution dispersion patterns and atmospheric chemistry
- **Health Impact Assessment**: Monitor air quality in areas where balloons operate
- **Climate Studies**: Analyze the relationship between weather, air quality, and atmospheric conditions
- **Operational Safety**: Ensure balloon operations in safe atmospheric conditions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap
- **Charts**: Chart.js for data visualization
- **Weather API**: Open-Meteo API
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with glassmorphism design

## üìù Notes

- The Windborne API data may sometimes be corrupted or incomplete - the application handles this robustly
- **Why OpenAQ API?** We chose OpenAQ because it provides free, real-time air quality data from government and research stations worldwide. Air quality affects balloon behavior through atmospheric density changes, visibility impacts, and environmental monitoring capabilities. OpenAQ offers comprehensive pollutant data (PM2.5, PM10, O3, etc.) with EPA-standard AQI calculations, enabling environmental monitoring and atmospheric research without any API costs or rate limits.
- Air quality data is **disabled by default** to avoid API rate limiting - use the "Fetch Live Air Quality" toggle to enable
- The application automatically refreshes data every 15 minutes
- All calculations use metric units for consistency
- Air quality data includes EPA-standard AQI calculations and health impact assessments
- Coordinate validation automatically fixes swapped latitude/longitude values from the Windborne API
