- **Interactive Charts**: Visual data representation with Chart.js for speed distribution and weather conditions

### Interactive Features
- **Material Design UI**: Clean, modern interface inspired by Google's Material Design
- **Single-Page Layout**: All elements visible in one viewport without scrolling
- **Dynamic Controls**: Toggle visibility of flight paths, constellation links, and weather data
- **Weather Toggle**: Enable/disable live weather data fetching with "Fetch Live Weather" button
- **Speed Filtering**: Filter balloons by speed categories (low, medium, high)
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh every 15 minutes with manual refresh option
- **Compact Stats Cards**: Key metrics displayed with intuitive icons
- **Improved Readability**: Better organized weather data and insights

## üöÄ Why Open-Meteo API?

I chose [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) as the external dataset because it provides superior weather data that directly impacts balloon flight behavior. Open-Meteo offers several advantages over other weather APIs:

- **No API Key Required**: Completely free for non-commercial use, no registration needed
- **Higher Resolution**: 1-11km resolution vs other APIs' lower resolution
- **More Frequent Updates**: Hourly updates with real-time data from national weather services
- **Open-Source**: AGPLv3 licensed, transparent and community-driven
- **Better Data Quality**: Partners with national weather services for accurate forecasts
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Global weather data with 80+ years of historical data

Atmospheric conditions like wind speed, direction, pressure, and temperature are crucial factors that influence balloon trajectories and flight patterns. By combining this high-quality weather data with the balloon tracking information, we can:

- **Predict Flight Paths**: Understand how weather conditions affect balloon movement
- **Optimize Operations**: Identify optimal weather conditions for balloon launches
- **Safety Analysis**: Monitor weather conditions that might impact balloon operations
- **Research Applications**: Study the relationship between atmospheric conditions and balloon behavior

This integration creates a powerful tool for atmospheric research, weather monitoring, and balloon flight optimization.

## üéØ Key Insights

The application provides several key insights:

1. **Flight Pattern Analysis**: Understanding how balloons move across different weather conditions
2. **Weather Impact Assessment**: Quantifying how atmospheric conditions affect balloon behavior
3. **Constellation Optimization**: Identifying optimal weather conditions for constellation operations
4. **Safety Monitoring**: Real-time weather monitoring for balloon operations
5. **Research Applications**: Data for atmospheric research and weather pattern analysis



## üìù Notes

- The Windborne API data may sometimes be corrupted or incomplete - the application handles this robustly
- **Why Open-Meteo API?** We chose Open-Meteo because it provides free, high-resolution weather data (1-11km resolution) that directly impacts balloon flight behavior. Unlike other weather APIs that require keys and have rate limits, Open-Meteo is completely free, open-source, and provides real-time data from national weather services. This enables us to analyze how atmospheric conditions (wind speed, direction, pressure, temperature) affect balloon trajectories without any setup costs or limitations.
- Weather data is **disabled by default** to avoid API rate limiting - use the "Fetch Live Weather" toggle to enable
- The application automatically refreshes data every 15 minutes
- All weather calculations use metric units for consistency
- Weather data includes WMO weather codes for detailed condition analysis
- Coordinate validation automatically fixes swapped latitude/longitude values from the Windborne API
